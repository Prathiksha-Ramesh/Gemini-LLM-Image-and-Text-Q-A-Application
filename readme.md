## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-llm-image-app.git
   cd gemini-llm-image-app
  ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

``` bash 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

``` bash

```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. For example:

``` bash 
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```


5. Run the application:
``` bash 
streamlit run vision.py
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`. The main features include:

- **Upload an Image:**
  - Choose an image file (JPG, JPEG, PNG) and upload it.

## Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables to manage sensitive information like API keys. These variables are stored in a `.env` file, which is loaded by the `python-dotenv` library. Below is a sample `.env` file configuration:

``` bash 
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```
